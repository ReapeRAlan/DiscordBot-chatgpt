Expect a Reply Within a Week: We take security issues seriously and will respond as quickly as possible. If you haven't received a response in a week, please send a follow-up email.
Vulnerability Handling: Once we've assessed the vulnerability, we will provide updates on how it will be addressed. If accepted, we'll work on a fix and decide on a disclosure date. If declined, we'll explain the reasons.
